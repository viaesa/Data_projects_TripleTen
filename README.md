# Data_projects_TripleTen
Projects I've worked on while studying Business Intelligence Analytics at TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | Norbu stress control| The project task was to analyze user data and find possible causes for the companyâ€™s low CR and retention rate. |
| 2 | [Instacart](https://github.com/zarina-perez/TripleTen_projects/tree/main/02-EDA_project) | The project task was to prepare a report that gives insight into the shopping habits of Instacart customers |
| 3 | A/A/B Test Analysis | The project task was to study the sales funnel and analyze the results of an A/B test for a food startup. |
| 4 | Machine Learning Customer Interaction Strategies | The project task was to help a chain of fitness clubs develop a customer retention strategy. |
| 5 | Product Returns Analysis and Root Cause Identification | In this project, I used Tableau to analyze product return patterns. I created several worksheets and dashboards to evaluate return rates, total return costs, and the number of returns across different product categories. I built trend lines, analyzed key return metrics, and identified root causes for high return rates. I also designed a clean and easy-to-navigate Tableau Story with captions that walked users through my findings. Throughout the project, I focused on clear visual storytelling, avoided dual-axis charts for simplicity, and concluded with actionable recommendations for reducing returns. |
| 6 | Shopify App Success Factors Analysis | For this project, I analyzed data from shopify.xlsx in Power BI to determine the key factors that influence the success of Shopify apps. I created interactive dashboards that explored important metrics such as app ratings, number of reviews, pricing models, and feature offerings. I allowed users to filter and dive deeper into trends, uncovering insights into what sets top-performing apps apart. Based on my analysis, I provided recommendations to help new developers increase their chances of success on the Shopify platform. |
| 7 | Restaurant Sales and Customer Behavior Insights | For my final Tableau project, I worked with Zomato restaurant data and focused on Sales Analysis. I created several visuals, including a Sales Overview, Sales by City, Top Selling Cuisine, Sales Quantity vs Revenue, Rating vs Sales, Trend Over Time, and a Veg vs Non-Veg comparison. I organized these into two dashboards: Dashboard 1: Sales Trends & Restaurant Performance, and Dashboard 2: Customer, Cuisine, & Location. Insights I wrapped up the project by writing a full analytical report that summarized my findings and provided conclusions and recommendations to help optimize restaurant sales and customer satisfaction. |
