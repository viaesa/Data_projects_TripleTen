# SQL and Zuber Data Analysis

This project utilized SQL to analyze Zuber data, focusing on ride patterns and driver behavior to optimize service operations. The aim was to derive insights that could lead to improved efficiency and better decision-making for the Zuber platform.

## Key Analyses

* **Ride Pattern Analysis:** SQL queries were used to identify common ride routes, peak travel times, and popular pick-up/drop-off locations.
* **Driver Behavior Insights:** Analysis of driver activity, including acceptance rates, completion rates, and average trip duration, to understand performance metrics.
* **Service Optimization Opportunities:** Identification of areas where Zuber's operations could be optimized based on data-driven insights.

## Summary

This analysis provides a foundational understanding of Zuber's operational dynamics through SQL-based data exploration. The insights gained can support strategic initiatives to enhance ride service efficiency and driver management.
